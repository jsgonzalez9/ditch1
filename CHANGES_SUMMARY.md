## Breaking Changes

### For Developers:
- **Stripe integration removed** - No longer functional
- **Payment flow changed** - Now requires iOS device for testing
- **Subscription management** - Now handled via Apple, not Stripe
- **Refunds** - Now subject to Apple's refund policy, not Stripe's

### For Users:
- **Payment method** - Must use Apple ID payment method
- **Subscription management** - Via iPhone Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions
- **Price changes** - Slightly different due to Apple's pricing tiers
- **Cancellation** - Via Apple, not in-app Stripe portal

## Testing Requirements

### Before App Store Submission:
1. Test all app features on real iOS device
2. Test IAP in sandbox environment
3. Verify privacy policy is accessible
4. Verify terms of service is accessible
5. Test with demo account (for reviewers)
6. Take required screenshots
7. Create app preview video (optional but recommended)

### IAP Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Products appear in app
- [ ] Monthly purchase works
- [ ] Yearly purchase works
- [ ] Purchase restore works
- [ ] Subscription status updates correctly
- [ ] Premium features unlock after purchase
- [ ] Subscription expiration handled correctly

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Current State:
1. **IAP not fully functional in web preview** - Requires iOS device and App Store Connect configuration
2. **Placeholder images** - App icons need to be created at all required sizes (see guide)
3. **Privacy policy URL** - Needs to be hosted publicly (in addition to in-app access)
4. **CocoaPods warning** - Normal on non-Mac systems, will work on Mac with Xcode
5. **Stripe webhooks removed** - Subscription webhooks need migration to Apple's server notifications

### Future Enhancements Needed:
1. **Server-to-server notifications** - Implement Apple's subscription notifications
2. **Subscription grace period** - Handle failed payments
3. **Offer codes** - Implement promotional pricing
4. **Introductory pricing** - Add free trial or intro pricing
5. **Family sharing** - Enable subscription sharing

## Rollback Plan

If needed to revert to Stripe:
1. Restore `src/stripe-config.ts` from git history
2. Restore Stripe Edge Functions
3. Update all component imports back to Stripe
4. Remove IAP plugin: `npm uninstall cordova-plugin-purchase`
5. Rebuild project

Git commit before IAP changes:
```bash
git log --oneline | grep -i "before IAP"
# Rollback command:
# git revert <commit-hash>
```

## Budget Considerations

### One-Time Costs:

- App icons/design: $0-500 (can DIY or hire designer)

### Ongoing Costs:
- Apple Developer Program: $99/year renewal

- Apple takes 30% first year, 15% after
- Monthly: $2.99 → ~$2.09 to you (first year) → ~$2.54 (after)

## Success Metrics

### Track These:
- App Store impressions
- App Store conversions (downloads)
- Free to paid conversion rate
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Churn rate
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Crash-free rate
- User ratings and reviews

### Initial Goals (First 3 Months):
- 1,000 downloads
- 50 paying subscribers
- $150 MRR
- 4.5+ star rating

## Conclusion

The app is now **technically ready** for App Store submission but requires:
1. Mac with Xcode for building
2. Apple Developer account
3. App icons created
4. IAP products configured in App Store Connect
5. Screenshots and marketing materials
6. Privacy policy hosted publicly

All code changes are complete. The remaining work is configuration, design assets, and submission logistics.

**Estimated time to submission:** 2-4 weeks (depending on resource availability)

**Estimated time to approval:** 1-7 days after submission

**Total time to launch:** 3-5 weeks from today
